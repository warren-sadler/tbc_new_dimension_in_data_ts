AN INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES

We have a dope virtual talk coming up on May 11th at 6 pm: "A New Dimension in Data: An Introduction to Vector Databases." It's going to be a blast! 🔥
 

Our very own Warren Sadler will be sharing his expertise, and our amazing moderator Kanesha Patterson will be guiding us through the discussion. You will even be treated to a live coding demo! 💻
 

Stay tuned for the link we'll be posting closer to the event. We can't wait to see you there!

Cheekwood Community Event

We've got an awesome 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 Outing planned for May 21st at Cheekwood in Nashville, TN, inspired by our recent hiking chats. 🌳🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

After the good vibes at Cheekwood, we'll be heading over to the 12 South area to grab a bite to eat. We will be meeting at the Estate entrance at 8:45 am and get ready for a chill day filled with adventure, laughs, and good company. 🎉

We can't wait to hang out with you all! 🙌 😄
